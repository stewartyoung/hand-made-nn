I want to make a neural network from scratch, in order to abstract away the technicalities of it's inner workings in the future. This will hopefully allow more complex networks to be made, whilst still having a good understanding of the mathematics of how the network is functioning underneath. 

Neural Networks are a combination of the following elements
* An **input layer**, **x**
* An arbitrary (i.e. can vary) amount of **hidden layers**
* An **output layer**, **ŷ**
* Weights and biases within each layer, **W and b**
* A choice of **activation function** for each hidden layer, **σ**
